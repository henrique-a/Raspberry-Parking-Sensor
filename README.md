# Raspberry-Parking-Sensor
This project consists of a parking sensor system made on Raspberry Pi 3. Three HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors were used to identify the position and distance of obstacles, a buzzer for sound alert during the parking process and a Nokia 5110 screen to display the distance of the nearest obstacle and whether it is on the left, right or directly behind the car.
